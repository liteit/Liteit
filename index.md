## Welcome to Liteit
For 20 years, Liteit have developed individuals and managers through self awarenes programs originated from Swedish military. Initially all excersises was based on pen and papers, but over time we have changed our way of working by introducing smarter solutions, based on software helping us progressing more effective. Currently we are no longer arranging events or hire individual mentors assisting our courses or program. That part of business has been divested to partners.    

## New opportunities
Liteit have broad experience in mentoring, business development and mobile app developlent and digitalization in general. We are open for funding of interresting concepts or ideas and share best practises. 

## We believe in that simple things can be pretty cool and add a significant value
This stupid simple landing page is an example, how cool does it feel to be able publishing it for free @github!?
There are thousends of low code examples that will save both time and money for small business.  In just a few years the market for simple best of breed SaaS services has exploeded and you pay for what you use. This trend is great and more processes can be adressed and valuable administrattion csan be reduced. Even if the most common processes within sales, markering or e-commerce and financial processes are adressed thare are a lot more that can be adressed. Happy to hear what problem  / challenge you have step into!?
