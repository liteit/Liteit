## Welcome to Liteit
For 20 years, Liteit have developed individuals and managers through self awarenes programs originated from Swedish military. Initially all excersises was based on pen and papers, but over time we have changed our way of working by introducing smarter solutions, based on software helping us progressing more effective. Currently we are no longer arranging events or hire individual mentors assisting our courses or program. That part of business has been divested to partners.    

## New opportunities
Liteit have broad experience in mentoring, business development and mobile app developlent and digitalization in general. We are open for funding of interresting concepts or ideas and share best practises. 

## We believe in that simple things can be pretty cool and add a significant value

Even if the most common processes within sales, markering or e-commerce and financial processes are adressed thare are a lote more to do.
